# Formula One Website Recreation

This website is for all fans of Formula One! This is a project that I used to learn about web development as well as using APIs. It is a direct mimic of the official Formula One website. I have not coded it to look exactly like the website; however, it does include data from the Ergast API such as Driver Standings and Constructor Standings that are updated live. The website also allows for a sign-in capability which allows you to pick your favorite drivers and teams that will appear on the home page.

In the future, I am planning to add telemetry and data visualization for the website which will be directly available.
